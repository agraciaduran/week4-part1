## 1. Confidence Intervals associated with a sample

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38,41,50, 27,32,41,48,60,43)

t.test(otter_length)


```

## T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches
```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x=otter_length, mu=50)
otter_test
```

## Two-sample t-test
```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32,44,18,26,50,33,42,40)
sierra_bighorns<- c(28,31,40,42,26,29,31)

t.test(x=desert_bighorns, y=sierra_bighorns)
```
